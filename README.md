An AI that is capable of predicting any day's weather based on the previous days conditions.

### Data
Data is stored in data.txt (duh) and holds the minimum and highest recorded weather for a day. It start from January 1, 2022 until March 23, 2023. It is stored as {high, low}. In this example, bracketed words are not present in the file:
//January 2020
[01/01/20]{high, low}
[01/02/20]{high, low}
The data progresses this way, going up a day each line. Lines begining with // are comments and thusly can be ignored when reading the file.
